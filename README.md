# OpenCV---Printer-Project
This c++ OpenCV project was created for a robotic printer that uses a marker to print dot art images on paper. 
The purpose of this program is to read a digital black and white image from a file using the open cv library, 
pixellate the image to a size suitable for the printer. Then, the image pixel information is output to a text file.
